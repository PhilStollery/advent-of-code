# Advent of code

See <http://adventofcode.com>

A group of technical people at Civica have created a Teams team to bring people together, and we have a private learderboard.

I'm going to be trying the new [VS Code interactive notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) and C# to solve the puzzles. 

A chance to flex your grey matter and programming skills (you might be able to do it all in Excel if you don't code).
